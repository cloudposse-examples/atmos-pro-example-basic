# atmos-pro-example-basic


A basic example demonstrating how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment. This repository shows the minimal configuration needed to get started with Atmos Pro workflows.


## Introduction

This is a basic example repository that demonstrates how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment. It provides a minimal setup to help you understand the core concepts of Atmos Pro workflows.

## Usage

This example demonstrates the minimal configuration needed to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions. The workflow follows these steps:

<details>
<summary><strong>On Pull Requests</strong></summary>

When a pull request is created or updated, Atmos Pro triggers `atmos terraform plan`:

1. **Developer makes a change** - You modify your infrastructure code
2. **Code is pushed to feature branch** - Changes are committed and pushed
3. **GitHub Actions trigger Atmos affected stacks** - Atmos identifies which stacks are affected by your changes
4. **Atmos uploads affected stacks** - The affected stack configurations are uploaded to Atmos Pro
5. **Atmos Pro dispatches plan workflows** - Atmos Pro automatically runs `atmos terraform plan` for affected components
6. **Atmos Pro updates status comment** - Results are posted as a comment on your pull request

This gives you visibility into what changes will be made to your infrastructure before merging.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>On Merged Pull Requests</strong></summary>

When a pull request is merged, Atmos Pro triggers `atmos terraform apply`:

1. **Pull request is merged** - Your changes are merged into the main branch
2. **GitHub Actions trigger Atmos affected stacks** - Atmos identifies which stacks need to be updated
3. **Atmos uploads affected stacks** - The affected stack configurations are uploaded to Atmos Pro
4. **Atmos Pro dispatches apply workflows** - Atmos Pro automatically runs `atmos terraform apply` for affected components
5. **Atmos Pro updates status comment** - Deployment results are posted as a comment on the merged PR

This ensures your infrastructure changes are automatically deployed when code is merged.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>

The minimal configuration includes:
- `atmos.yaml` - Main Atmos configuration file
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows for plan and apply
- `components/` - Your infrastructure components (Terraform root modules)
- `stacks/` - Atmos stack configurations
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Required GitHub Variables</strong></summary>

You'll need to configure the following GitHub variables in your repository settings:

- `ATMOS_PRO_WORKSPACE_ID` - Your Atmos Pro workspace ID
- `ATMOS_VERSION` - The version of Atmos to use (e.g., `1.181.0`)
- `ATMOS_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to your Atmos configuration file (e.g., `atmos.yaml`)
</details>
