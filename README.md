A basic example demonstrating how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment. This repository shows the minimal configuration needed to get started with Atmos Pro workflows.


## Introduction

This is a basic example repository that demonstrates how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment. It provides a minimal setup to help you understand the core concepts of Atmos Pro workflows.

For comprehensive documentation and advanced features, visit [atmos-pro.com/docs](https://atmos-pro.com/docs).



## Usage

This example demonstrates the minimal configuration needed to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions. The workflow is simple:

### 1. Create a Pull Request
When you create a pull request, it automatically triggers the **plan** workflow. This will:
- Run `atmos plan` for all affected components
- Show you what changes will be made to your infrastructure
- Provide feedback in the PR comments

### 2. Merge the Pull Request
When you merge the pull request, it automatically triggers the **apply** workflow. This will:
- Run `atmos apply` for all affected components
- Apply the planned changes to your infrastructure
- Update the deployment status

## Configuration

The minimal configuration includes:
- `atmos.yaml` - Main Atmos configuration file
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows for plan and apply
- `components/` - Your infrastructure components
- `stacks/` - Stack configurations

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Configure your AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets
3. Update the stack configurations in `stacks/` to match your environment
4. Create a pull request to test the plan workflow
5. Merge the PR to trigger the apply workflow
