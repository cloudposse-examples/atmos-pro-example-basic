This demonstration showcases mock components representing a typical service-oriented architecture and their
dependencies. It is designed to work seamlessly with Atmos Pro, coordinating a rollout in dependency order by
dispatching GitHub Action workflows.

> ### Did you know?
>
> By leveraging Atmos in conjunction with Cloud Posse's [_expertise in AWS_](https://cloudposse.com),
> [_terraform blueprints_](https://cloudposse.com/services/), and our
> [_knowledgeable community_](https://slack.cloudposse.com), teams can achieve operational mastery and innovation
> faster, transforming their infrastructure management practices into a competitive advantage.

## Usage

This repository demonstrates how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions to plan and apply Terraform. We have created mock
components here that do not actually create any resources in your AWS account. This is a demonstration repository to
show how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions. The component dependency mapping is as follows:
